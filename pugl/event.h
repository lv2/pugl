/**
   Key press/release event.

   Keys that correspond to a Unicode character have `character` and `utf8` set.
   Other keys will have `character` 0, but `special` may be set if this is a
   known special key.

   A key press may be part of a multi-key sequence to generate a wide
   character.  If `filter` is set, this event is part of a multi-key sequence
   and should be ignored if the application is reading textual input.
   Following the series of filtered press events, a press event with
   `character` and `utf8` (but `keycode` 0) will be sent.  This event will have
   no corresponding release event.

   Generally, an application should either work with raw keyboard press/release
   events based on `keycode` (ignoring events with `keycode` 0), or
   read textual input based on `character` or `utf8` (ignoring releases and
   events with `filter` 1).  Note that blindly appending `utf8` will yield
   incorrect text, since press events are sent for both individually composed
   keys and the resulting synthetic multi-byte press.
